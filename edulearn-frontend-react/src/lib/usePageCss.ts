 * Swap a page's lifted stylesheet into the <style id="page-css"> slot that
 * sits between theme.css and vivid.css in index.html.
 *
 * The static site loaded exactly one page stylesheet at a time, and those
 * sheets reuse generic names (.card, .wrap, .grid) for different things while
 * each declaring its own :root and body rules. Swapping — rather than loading
 * them all at once — is what keeps routes from bleeding into each other, and
 * keeps vivid.css winning by source order the way it was written to.
 *
 * useLayoutEffect (not useEffect) so the swap lands before the browser paints;
 * otherwise every route change would flash the previous page's styling.
