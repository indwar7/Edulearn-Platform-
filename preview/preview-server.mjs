/* ============================================================
   BESTBRAIN — LOCAL PREVIEW SERVER  (scratchpad only)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Serves the real site straight from the repo WITHOUT modifying a
   single file. Each .html response is rewritten in memory to add
   preview-only scripts:

     session.js  — after <head>, before role-guard.js, so guarded
                   pages open without a login round-trip
     kid-bg.js   — the seamless animated background + dark tokens
     kid-ui.js   — glass design system, sidebar rail, top HUD
     kid-home.js — the premium homepage (index.html only)
     kid-auth.js — login/signup surface
     kid-call.js — the AI-tutor video-call skin

   It also answers /api/pal/tutor/stream itself: tutor.html's voice
   loop is on-device, but the TEXT goes to the server over SSE. The
   real backend needs prod CORS and a real JWT, so the demo brain
   below replies in exactly the frame format api.js parses.

   Stop the server and the site is byte-for-byte what git has.

  { k: ['metal', 'metals', 'धातु'],
    a: 'Metals! Look around your kitchen — the steel plate, the copper bottom of a pan, the aluminium foil. Metals are usually hard and shiny, and they have superpowers: electricity and heat pass through them easily, which is why wires are copper and pans are metal. Hit a metal with a hammer and it flattens into a sheet instead of breaking — that property is called being malleable. Iron, copper, aluminium, gold and silver are all metals. Compare that with wood or coal — dull, breaks easily, no electricity — those are non-metals!' },
  { k: ['non-metal', 'non metal', 'nonmetal', 'अधातु'],
    a: 'Non-metals are the opposite team! They are usually dull, not shiny, and they break into pieces if you hammer them, like coal or sulphur. Electricity and heat do not pass through them easily, which is actually useful — that is why electric wires are covered with plastic or rubber to keep you safe. And the amazing one: oxygen, which you breathe, and carbon, which your pencil lead is made of, are both non-metals. Life itself runs on non-metals!' },
  { k: ['photosynthesis', 'plants make', 'make their food', 'प्रकाश संश्लेषण'],
    a: 'Photosynthesis is how a plant cooks its own food, and the leaf is the kitchen. It takes water from the roots, carbon dioxide from the air, and energy from sunlight. The green colour, chlorophyll, catches that sunlight. Mixing all three, the leaf makes glucose — the plant food — and releases oxygen, the same oxygen you are breathing right now. So every breath you take, thank a leaf!' },
  { k: ['fraction', 'fractions', 'भिन्न'],
    a: 'Think of a chapati! Cut it into four equal pieces and eat three — you ate three by four. The bottom number says how many equal pieces the whole was cut into, the top number says how many you have. And remember, the bigger the bottom number, the smaller each piece. That is why half a chapati is more than one-eighth!' },
  { k: ['shadow', 'light travels', 'परछाई', 'छाया'],
    a: 'Light always travels in a straight line — it never bends around corners on its own. So when something solid blocks its path, the light cannot reach behind it, and that dark patch is your shadow. Try this tonight: hold a torch close to your hand and the shadow grows huge, move it away and it shrinks. That is the angle of the straight rays changing!' },
  { k: ['water cycle', 'evaporation', 'बारिश'],
    a: 'The water cycle is nature\'s recycling machine. The sun heats rivers and seas, and water rises as invisible vapour — evaporation. High up it cools into tiny droplets that make clouds — condensation. When the drops get heavy they fall as rain — precipitation. The rain fills the rivers, and it all restarts. The water you drank today might once have been a cloud over the sea!' },
  { k: ['gravity', 'गुरुत्व', 'why do things fall'],
    a: 'Gravity is an invisible pull that every big object has, and Earth is very big, so it pulls everything towards itself. That is why your ball always comes down instead of floating away. The Moon has about one-sixth of Earth\'s gravity, so there you could jump six times higher. Even now, gravity is politely holding you in your chair!' },
  { k: ['integer', 'integers', 'number line', 'negative number'],
    a: 'Integers are all the whole numbers — positive, negative and zero. Picture a number line: zero in the middle, positives marching right, negatives marching left. One golden rule — left is always smaller, right is always bigger. So minus five is smaller than minus two because it sits further left. Think of a lift: floors above ground are positive, the basements are negative!' },
  { k: ['magnet', 'magnets', 'चुंबक'],
    a: 'Magnets pull things made of iron, nickel and cobalt, but not plastic, wood, or even every metal. Every magnet has two poles, north and south. Opposite poles attract, same poles push away — bring two north poles together and feel them fight! And a hanging magnet always turns to point north-south, which is exactly how a compass helps sailors find their way.' },
  { k: ['electric', 'circuit', 'bulb glow', 'battery', 'current'],
    a: 'Electricity flows like water in a pipe, but it needs a complete loop called a circuit. Battery, wire, bulb, back to the battery — if the loop is complete, the bulb glows. Break it anywhere and it goes dark, which is exactly what a switch does. Electricity flows easily through copper, so wires are copper inside and rubber outside. Never poke anything into a socket — respect the current!' },
  { k: ['states of matter', 'solid', 'liquid and gas'],
    a: 'Everything around you is solid, liquid or gas. In a solid like ice, the tiny particles are packed tight and hold their shape. In a liquid like water they are looser, so it flows and takes the shape of the glass. In a gas like steam they fly around freely and fill the room. And the magic — the same water can be all three. Only the particle packing changes!' },
  { k: ['decimal', 'decimals', 'दशमलव'],
    a: 'Decimals are fractions wearing a different dress! The dot separates the whole from the part. Money is the easiest way to see it: one rupee fifty paise is one point five zero. That point five is half a rupee, which is the fraction one by two. After the dot, the first place is tenths, the second is hundredths. You have been doing decimals every time you count change!' },
  { k: ['separation', 'sieving', 'winnowing', 'filtration', 'handpicking'],
    a: 'How do you get stones out of rice? Separation methods! Handpicking — pick the big bits out. Sieving — shake through a jaali, small falls, big stays. Winnowing — let the wind blow the light husk away while heavy grain drops straight down. Filtration — pour through a cloth, water passes and tea leaves stay, exactly like a chai ki chhanni. Each method uses one difference: size, weight, or solubility.' },
  { k: ['air', 'atmosphere', 'हवा'],
    a: 'Air is all around you even though you cannot see it. It is a mixture — mostly nitrogen, then oxygen, plus a little carbon dioxide and water vapour. You breathe in the oxygen, plants take the carbon dioxide. Want proof air exists? Wave a book at your face — that push is air. An empty bottle is never really empty: flip it underwater and watch the bubbles escape!' },
  { k: ['fibre', 'fabric', 'cotton', 'wool comes from'],
    a: 'Your clothes have a journey behind them! Fibres are the thin threads everything starts from. Cotton comes from the fluffy boll on a plant, picked, cleaned and spun into yarn. Wool comes from a sheep\'s warm coat, cut like a haircut that grows back. Silk comes from a silkworm\'s cocoon. Then yarn is woven — over, under, over, under — into the fabric of your school uniform!' },
  { k: ['body movement', 'joints', 'skeleton', 'bones'],
    a: 'Your body bends because of joints, the places where two bones meet. The ball-and-socket joint in your shoulder spins your arm in a full circle. The hinge joint in your knee works like a door, only back and forth. The pivot joint in your neck lets you say no. Feel your elbow while you bend it — that is a hinge joint working. Without joints you would be as stiff as a statue!' },
  { k: ['earliest people', 'hunter', 'gatherer', 'stone age', 'cave'],
    a: 'The earliest people were hunter-gatherers — they hunted animals and gathered fruits, nuts and roots. Here is the interesting part: they never stayed in one place. They moved because animals moved, because plants ripen in different seasons, and because they needed water. They made sharp tools from stone and painted on cave walls — and those paintings still exist thousands of years later!' },
  { k: ['taro', 'waterfall'],
    a: 'Taro\'s Reward is a lovely story. Taro was a poor, hardworking woodcutter who loved his old parents. One cold day his father wished for something warm to drink, but Taro had no money. While working he found a magical waterfall that gave sake instead of water! Because Taro was honest and kind, the waterfall rewarded him. When greedy neighbours tried, they got only plain water. Kindness brings its own reward.' },
  { k: ['living', 'non-living', 'habitat', 'organisms'],
    a: 'What makes something alive? Living things eat, breathe, grow, move, respond and reproduce — and they need a home suited to them, called a habitat. A camel\'s wide feet are perfect for hot sand, a fish\'s gills pull breath from water. Now the tricky one: is a car alive? It moves and drinks petrol, but it cannot grow or make baby cars — so no. A seed looks dead, but plant it and it grows. Very much alive!' },
  { k: ['quiz me on motion', 'motion quiz', 'quiz on motion'],
    a: 'Quiz time! Question one: a car on a straight road shows which type of motion — straight line, circular, or periodic? Question two: what motion does a fan blade show? Question three: a swing goes to and fro again and again — what is that motion called? Think about them, then tell me your answers one by one and I will check!' },
  { k: ['hello', 'hi pal', 'namaste', 'नमस्ते', 'who are you'],
    a: 'Namaste! I am PAL, your AI study buddy from BestBrain. Ask me any doubt from your Class 6 books — maths, science, history, English, anything. Try asking: what are metals? Or, explain fractions with a chapati. I will explain it out loud, nice and simple. What shall we learn today?' }
